The Quran, embraced by hearts across the world as the timeless word of God, has captivated humanity for over fourteen centuries with its profound wisdom, matchless eloquence, and spiritual depth. Yet, beyond its literary majesty and moral guidance, lies a lesser-known but awe-inspiring dimension: its numerical precision. This dimension is alluded to in Surah Al-Muddathir, verse 30, which states: "عَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ" ("Over it are nineteen").

A careful exploration of these numeric patterns reveals astonishing intricacies that not only affirm the divine nature of this sacred text but also invite reflection and wonder. The mention of 'nineteen' has intrigued scholars for centuries, pointing to a mathematical structure woven into the Quran, one that modern computation is only beginning to uncover.

Some of these patterns are so large and precise that they can only be tested using modern programming languages. For example, the 274-digit number in the final point exceeds the capacity of native C++ and requires arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

Surah Al-Fatiha, the opening chapter of the Quran, brilliantly exemplifies these numerical miracles. Let us journey through the remarkable numeric patterns embedded within this short yet immensely significant chapter. To verify these patterns yourself, you can run the full code in this Colab notebook:

**1. 19 Letters in the First Verse**

The first verse of Surah Al-Fatiha, "Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Rahim," contains exactly 19 letters. This is a remarkable alignment with the number 19 mentioned in the Quran (Surah Al-Muddathir, 74:30), hinting at a divine numeric structure.

```python
first_ayah_length = len(surahs[0][0].replace(" ", ""))
print(f"1. Length of first Ayah: {first_ayah_length}")
print("Divisible by 19:", first_ayah_length % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 1. Length of first Ayah: 19 <br> Divisible by 19: True

This code counts the number of characters in the first verse and checks if it's divisible by 19.

---

**2. Sequential Structure Matches 19**

Concatenating the Surah number (1) and the Ayah sequence (1 to 7) gives us 11234567. This number is also divisible by 19, revealing an intentional numeric structure.

Equation: `Surah No | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7`

```python
surah_ayah_number = 11234567
print(f"2. Surah and Ayah numbers: {surah_ayah_number}")
print("Divisible by 19:", surah_ayah_number % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 2. Surah and Ayah numbers: 11234567 <br> Divisible by 19: True

The code checks whether this specific sequence is divisible by 19.


---

**3. Product of Verse Lengths**

If you multiply the character lengths of each of the seven verses, the result is a large number divisible by 19.

Equation: `L₁ × L₂ × L₃ × L₄ × L₅ × L₆ × L₇`

```python
product_of_lengths = 1
for verse in surahs[0]:
    product_of_lengths *= len(verse.replace(" ", ""))
print(f"3. {len(str(product_of_lengths))}-digit number: {product_of_lengths}")
print("Divisible by 19:", product_of_lengths % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 3. 9-digit number: 627005016 <br> Divisible by 19: True

The code loops through each verse, measures the length, multiplies all lengths to test divisibility.

---

**4. Character Counts Concatenated**

Concatenating the Surah number (1) and the character count of each verse gives a 15-digit number divisible by 19.

Equation: `Surah No | L₁L₂L₃L₄L₅L₆L₇`

```python
number = '1'
for verse in surahs[0]:
    number += str(len(verse.replace(' ', '')))
print(f"4. {len(number)}-digit number:", number)
print("Divisible by 19:", int(number) % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 4. 15-digit number: `1 19 17 12 11 19 18 43` <br> Divisible by 19: True

Each verse's length is appended to form a long string that starts with "1" and is tested for divisibility.

---

**5. Differences Between Length and Abjad**

The absolute difference between each verse’s letter count and its Abjad (numerical) sum [(read more about abjad value here)](https://numericalmiraclesofquran.com/article/67fcfa73e91a7c85a4ff757e)  is concatenated into a number that is also divisible by 19. 

Equation: `Surah No | abs(L₁-A₁) | abs(L₂-A₂) … | abs(L₇–A₇)`

```python
structured_number = "1"
for verse in surahs[0]:
    verse_length = len(verse.replace(" ", ""))
    abjad_sum = sum(calculate_abjad_value(word) for word in verse.split())
    structured_number += str(abs(verse_length - abjad_sum))
print(f"5. {len(structured_number)}-digit number:", structured_number)
print("Divisible by 19:", int(structured_number) % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 5. 24-digit number: 176756460623081710545966 <br> Divisible by 19: True

The code calculates the absolute differences and concatenates them to evaluate the pattern.

---

**6. Paired Lengths and Abjad Values**

Joining each verse’s length with its Abjad value results in a long number that remains divisible by 19.

Equation: `Surah No | L₁A₁ | L₂A₂ | L₃A₃ | L₄A₄ | L₅A₅ | L₆A₆ | L₇A₇`

```python
structured_number = '1'
for verse in surahs[0]:
    verse_abjad_value = sum(calculate_abjad_value(word) for word in verse.split())
    structured_number += str(len(verse.replace(' ', ''))) + str(verse_abjad_value)
print(f"6. {len(structured_number)}-digit number:", structured_number)
print("Divisible by 19:", int(structured_number) % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 6. 38-digit number: 11978617581126181124119836181072436009 <br> Divisible by 19: True

---

**7. Reverse Structure Still Divisible**

Reversing the sequence formed by verse lengths and Abjad values above still results in a number divisible by 19.

Equation: `A₇L₇ | A₆L₆ | … | A₁L₁|Surah No`

```python
structured_number = ['1']
for verse in surahs[0]:
    verse_abjad_value = sum(calculate_abjad_value(word) for word in verse.split())
    structured_number.append(str(len(verse.replace(' ', ''))))
    structured_number.append(str(verse_abjad_value))
structured_number_reversed = ''.join(structured_number[::-1])
print(f"7. {len(structured_number_reversed)}-digit number:", structured_number_reversed)
print("Divisible by 19:", int(structured_number_reversed) % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 7. 38-digit number: 60094310721883619241116181258117786191 <br> Divisible by 19: True

The list is reversed after combining lengths and values, then converted to a number to test.

---

**8. Cumulative Values Form a Pattern**

The cumulative sum of letter counts and Abjad values across verses, when concatenated, also yields a number divisible by 19. 

Equation: `Surah No | ΣL₁ΣA₁ | ΣL₂ΣA₂ | … | ΣL₇ΣA₇`

```python
cumulative_length = 0
cumulative_abjad = 0
structured_number = "1"
for verse in surahs[0]:
    verse_length = len(verse.replace(" ", ""))
    abjad_value = sum(calculate_abjad_value(word) for word in verse.split())
    cumulative_length += verse_length
    cumulative_abjad += abjad_value
    structured_number += str(cumulative_length) + str(cumulative_abjad)
print(f"8. {len(structured_number)}-digit number:", structured_number)
print("Divisible by 19:", int(structured_number) % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 8. 44-digit number: 11978636136748198559222678306296413413910143 <br> Divisible by 19: True

This approach builds a number using running totals of lengths and Abjad values.

---

**9. Structured Composition of Verse Data**

Each verse’s position, its length, and its total Abjad value are combined one after the other into a long number. The full number ends up being 45 digits long and is still divisible by 19.

Equation: `Surah No | 1L₁A₁ | 2L₂A₂ | 3L₃A₃ | 4L₄A₄ | 5L₅A₅ | 6L₆A₆ | 7L₇A₇`

```python
structured_number_interleaved = "1"
for verse_no, verse in enumerate(surahs[0], start=1):
    verse_length = len(verse.replace(" ", ""))
    abjad_value = sum(calculate_abjad_value(word) for word in verse.split())
    structured_number_interleaved += str(verse_no) + str(verse_length) + str(abjad_value)
print(f"9. {len(structured_number_interleaved)}-digit number:", structured_number_interleaved)
print("Divisible by 19:", int(structured_number_interleaved) % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 9. 45-digit number: 111978621758131261841124151983661810727436009 <br> Divisible by 19: True

This process clearly and systematically encodes key data from each verse into one long integer in this format: `position of verse | length of verse | abjad value for verse` and the result is still a 45-digit number divisible by 19.

---

**10. Detailed Letter-by-Letter Pattern**

A meticulous combination of Surah number, Ayah number, verse length, and Abjad values of each letter produces a 274-digit number divisible by 19.

Equation: `Surah No | 1L₁ a₁₁a₁₂…a₁m | 2L₂ a₂₁a₂₂…a₂n | … | 7L₇ a₇₁…a₇p`

```python
structured_number = '17'
for verse_no, verse in enumerate(surahs[0], start=1):
    structured_number += str(verse_no)
    structured_number += str(len(verse.replace(" ", "")))
    for word in verse.split():
        for letter in word:
            structured_number += str(calculate_abjad_value(letter))
print(f"10. {len(structured_number)}-digit number:", structured_number)
print("Divisible by 19:", int(structured_number) % 19 == 0)
```

Output: 10. 274-digit number: 1711926040130305130200840501302008104021713084043030520021307030401050312130200840501302008104041140302010640130410505191101205070246110120506040070105061815450113090200913040604001001040743902009130700105015070404007030105401000102001304010008006270301054063011308001301050 <br> Divisible by 19: True

It dissects every letter, fetches its Abjad value, and builds a highly detailed numeric structure for evaluation.

---
**11.  Count occurrences of letters in "Allah" (اللّٰه)**

If we count how many times each letter in the word "Allah" (ا، ل، ل، ه) appears in Surah Al-Fātiḥah. The resulting pattern forms a number divisible by 19.

Equation: `Surah No | Count(ا) | Count(ل) | Count(ل) | Count(ه)`

```python
allah_letters = ['ا', 'ل', 'ل', 'ه']
letter_counts = dict.fromkeys(set(allah_letters), 0)
text = ''.join(verse.replace('أ', 'ا').replace('إ', 'ا') for verse in surahs[0])
counter = Counter(text)
pattern_number = '1' + ''.join(str(counter.get(letter, 0)) for letter in allah_letters)

print(f"11. {len(pattern_number)}-digit number:", pattern_number)
print("Divisible by 19:", int(pattern_number) % 19 == 0)
```
Output: 11. 8-digit number: 12222225 <br> Divisible by 19: True
